	NOTES:
	Enforce data input policy on front end
	No  ' , " , ; , : , < , > , # , *, } , {  and other chars in input fields.
	I have in backend sanitize_input() function that removes these and some other characters from input fields.

	Enforce Password policy on backend
	Minimum 8 characters, must have 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character.
	In backend I have password_policy() function that checks if password meets these requirements when creating or updating password.

	Get random player for tournament (Matchmaking)?
	Is there a need for api or table for this?
